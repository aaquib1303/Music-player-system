## Tech Stack

- HTML5 â€“ Semantic layout structure
- CSS3 â€“ Custom styling and responsive media queries
- JavaScript (Vanilla) â€“ Playback logic, playlist rendering, and DOM interaction
- Git & GitHub Pages â€“ Version control and deployment

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaquib1303/Music-player-system.git
   cd Music-player-system
   ```
   
2. Start a local development server:

    Using Python (for Python 3):

    ```
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

    Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser (recommended for fetch-based playlist loading).

## Notes
For full functionality (like dynamic file fetching using fetch()), you must run the project on a local server. Directly opening index.html may not load playlists correctly.

Ensure all file paths are relative and folder structure is preserved after cloning.

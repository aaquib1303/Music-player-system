##  Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Media Queries, Custom Utility Classes)
* **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation)

---

##  Responsive Design Strategy

* Below **700px**: Album pic + song details wrap
* Below **500px**: Playbar components stack vertically:

  * Song image
  * Song name and artist
  * Controls (play/pause, next, previous)
  * Seekbar
  * Volume control

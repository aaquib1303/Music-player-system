# 🎵 Music Player System

A sleek and responsive web-based music player built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, just pure frontend magic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Media Queries, Custom Utility Classes)
* **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation)
* **SVG Icons** for buttons

---

## 📱 Responsive Design Strategy

* Below **700px**: Album pic + song details wrap
* Below **500px**: Playbar components stack vertically:

  * Song image
  * Song name and artist
  * Controls (play/pause, next, previous)
  * Seekbar
  * Volume control
